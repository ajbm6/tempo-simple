# Introduction

TempoSimple is a time tracking software allowing you to:

* enter the time spent on tasks
* generate reports out of it

## What's the point?

Those tasks (time tacking and report writting) are done manually anyway, and
they take time which could be spent doing actual work. Automate the boring
stuff!
